# -Random-Vehicle-Number-Generator-C-Project-
A C++ console app that generates random vehicle numbers based on city and year input. Ensures unique 9-character codes, validates input, and checks if a number already exists using sets. Great for learning randomization, validation, and modular programming in C++.
